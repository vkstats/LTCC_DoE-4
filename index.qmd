# Welcome {.unnumbered}

These lecture notes support Week 4 of the [London Taught Course Centre](https://www.ltcc.ac.uk) 2024-25 advanced module on "Design of Experiments".

The main focus is on two areas - experimental design under treatment interference and multi-objective experimental design - that are active research areas. As such, do not necessarily expect all the material to align with nice tidy results!

## About {.unnumbered}

I am a [Lecturer in Statistics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/vasiliki-koutra) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/mathematics) at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk). My research interests are in the design of experiments, particularly experiments with connected units. I have recently developed a new module on Design of Experiments for King's MSc and undergraduate programmes.
